# Blueprints

This directory is experimenting with Multipass Blueprints to configure our Opensearch Machine. Unfortunately I didn't get this working but am leaving it hear to see if the Blueprint feature of Multipass becomes better documented so we can use it in Caltech Library along with cloud-init files to manage our local development virtual machines.
